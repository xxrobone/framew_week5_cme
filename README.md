# Assingment 5 frameworks

## website for MR TONY GOGO
So after getting and OK for my project, I decided to create a website for Mr Anthony Lewis Foster
Build a simple website with some content, images, videos, and a contact page

## page demo
https://tonygogo.vercel.app/

## Contact page
I used emailjs for contact page form,
There is a lot of good libraries for forms, but I wanted to try to do it myself first in nextjs
I would probably use on of these in the future, - React-Hook-Form, Formik, and React-Final-Form

email works on demo page (please dont spam ;)... )
